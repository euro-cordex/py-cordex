Python tools for the Cordex Community.

Why
---

The goal of this software package is to have a unified common code base for typical and reacurring tasks in the `CORDEX <https://cordex.org/>`_ community.
More precisely, there are several tasks related to regional climate model data processing that are model independent and could become unified. This should
enable better reproducability and exchange of scientific analyses in the community.

Data Access
^^^^^^^^^^^
The future of climate modelling has to deal with huge datasets and efficient use of storage and computing resources. This software package should help managing
these tasks by giving easy access to remote datasets (e.g., ESGF or observational datasets from OPenDAP or cloud resources) using external 
catalogs to guarantee maximum reproducibility and compatibility between data centers and data users.

Meta Data
^^^^^^^^^
Access to meta data should be automatic and machine readable to avoid humans to do boring, repitive tasks that are error-prone. For that purpose, easy access to
meta information should be guaranteed by tables collected here: https://github.com/euro-cordex/tables 

Features
--------

* Manage Cordex Meta Data
* Tools to manage Cordex Domain Data
* Easy Cordex ESGF Access

For planned features, please have a look at the `issues <https://github.com/euro-cordex/py-cordex/issues>`_, grab one, and `contribute <https://py-cordex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_!

Installation
------------

You can install the package directly from github using pip:


.. code-block:: console

    pip install git+https://github.com/euro-cordex/py-cordex


If you want to contribute, I recommend cloning the repository and installing the package in development mode, e.g.


.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/euro-cordex/py-cordex
    cd cordex
    pip install -e .


This will install the package but you can still edit it and you don't need the package in your :code:`PYTHONPATH`

Highlights
----------

Use the domain module to create Cordex domains safe and easy:

.. code-block:: python

    from cordex import domain as dm

    # available tables
    print(dm.tables())
    # available domains names
    print(dm.names())
    # available domains names
    print(dm.names('cordex-core'))
    # print cordex core table
    print(dm.table('cordex-core'))

    # show domains with some dummy data (uses cdo topo)
    for short_name, domain in dm.domains().items():
        print(domain)
        domain.to_netcdf(short_name+'.nc', dummy='topo')

Using the ESGF module for browsing the file system and creating pandas dataframes of file selections:
(DKRZ example).

    Note that DKRZ also provides an **intake-esm** table (https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
    for browsing and searchin MIP data at DKRZ. I highly recommend to have a look at it and create tables
    for your own data pool. For creating a table, you could use our cordex conventions module!

.. code-block:: python

    import datetime as dt
    from cordex.ESGF import get_selection, conventions

    project_id = 'CMIP5'
    root       = '/pool/data/CMIP5/cmip5'

    filter   = {'institute'       : 'MPI-M',
                'product'         : 'output1',
                'variable'        : 'tas',
                'model'           : 'MPI-ESM-LR',
                'modeling_realm'  : 'atmos',
                'experiment'      : 'historical',
                'ensemble_member' : 'r1i1p1'}

    # get a selection of files (using pandas dataframes)
    selection = get_selection(project_id, root=root, filter=filter)
    print(selection)

    # create a finer selection and convert dates to datetime objects
    selection = selection.subset(variable='pr').to_datetime()
    # get a timeseries of files
    selection = selection.select_timerange([dt.datetime(1990,1,1),dt.datetime(2000,1,1)])
    print(selection)

Use the ESGF module to create your filename using an attribute dictionary. Use the CORDEX filenaming
convetion (or create your own!):

.. code-block:: python

    from cordex import ESGF as esgf

    root       = '/my_root'

    # define attributes
    attributes   = {'institute_id'    : 'GERICS',
                    'product'         : 'output',
                    'model_id'        : 'GERICS-REMO2015',
                    'experiment_id'   : 'evaluation',
                    'driving_model_id': 'ECMWF-ERAINT',
                    'variable'        : 'pr',
                    'rcm_version_id'  : 'v1',
                    'date'            : 'v20200221',
                    'frequency'       : 'day',
                    'CORDEX_domain'   : 'EUR-11',
                    'suffix'          : 'nc',
                    'ensemble'        : 'r1i1p1'}

    # we use the CORDEX convention as example
    convention = esgf.CORDEX()
    # print the convention patterns 
    print(convention.path_conv.conv_str)
    print(convention.filename_conv.conv_str)
    # only filename
    filename = convention.filename(**attributes, startdate='20010101', enddate='20010131')
    # only path
    path     = convention.path(**attributes, startdate='20010101', enddate='20010131')
    # only filename with path
    file     = convention.pattern(root, **attributes, startdate='20010101', enddate='20010131')


Use the conventions module to create your own filenaming conventions:

.. code-block:: python

    from cordex import conventions as conv

    # create your own filename convention string and list
    filename_conv_str  = 'my_convention_{variable}_{model_id}_{domain_id}.nc'
    path_conv_list     = ['model_id','variable']

    # create conventions for filename and path
    filename_conv = conv.FileNameConvention(filename_conv_str)
    path_conv     = conv.FilePathConvention(path_conv_list)


    # now define your attributes to fill the templates.
    root = '/my_root'
    attributes = {'model_id'        : 'GERICS-REMO2015',
                  'variable'        : 'pr',
                  'domain_id'       : 'EUR-11'}

    # create filename and path
    filename = filename_conv.pattern(**attributes)
    path     = path_conv.pattern(root, **attributes)

    # create combined file convention
    file_conv = conv.FileConvention(path_conv, filename_conv)

    # create full filename with path
    file = file_conv.pattern(root, **attributes)
